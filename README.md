# Jefferson-County-Education-Mapping

All the code needed to build map showing census data in R. 
You will need a API Key from the American Community Survey.
This is 2015 5-Year Estimates.

Make sure to install all packages before running code. 

The first part of the code will give you a map of percentage of persons with a college degree.

The second half of the code will give you a map of the percentage of households where income is more than 50,000 dollars

Median income was 48.695 dollars.
